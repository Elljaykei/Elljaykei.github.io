            This series is a heptalogy also known as a 7 book series. Why is this book series my favourite and why is it rated 11/10?
            This series is what got me into reading. Prior to this series I was always forced into reading mystery and horror books which my sisters loved which made me detest books.
            Having read this series I knew that my interest lay in "Supernatural" and "Sci-Fi".

            The series follow the story of nine human-looking aliens brought to Earth when they were six years old.
            Their purpose is to grow into their powers and return to their planet, Lorien, and get it back from the evil Mogadorians. The teenagers have been protected by a charm, which only allows them to be killed in a set order, and by non-gifted guardians called Cêpan.
            Up to the beginning of the first book, six have survived and reached 15 years. As their powers, their Legacies, start to develop they can't stay hidden anymore.

            This series has an amazing story development considering its almost cliché storyline.
            For people who absolutely love stories where the main character works towards the peak of life, this is no doubt the novel for you. And if you are a major fan of comics,
            The comic adaptation of this novel is truly remarkable.

            10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as "Hunters". However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the "World's Weakest". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!
