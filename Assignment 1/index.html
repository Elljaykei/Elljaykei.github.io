          <h1>My Love for Reading</h1>
          <div class="intro">
            <p>
              So before anything I would like to say that I am nothing short of a bookworm.
              I would like to first talk about why I love reading.
              Like quite alot of people, I was not a fan of reading in the beginning.
              I will be listing off a few reasons why people do not love reading and how to start reading.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firsly, people who do not like reading probably just have not found the genre in which they are interested in.
              It was the same for me. This book is the first book I ever enjoyed, it was only then that I discovered my love for books lied in the "Supernatural" genre.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, another reason why people may not like books is the fact that they have not experienced the joy of reading fully.
              Some people having not given books a chance to let the story develop, never get to enjoy the feeling of seeing a story unfold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence I'd like to ask people to give books a chance and read.

          <h1>Why this page?</h1>

            <p>
              As someone who really enjoys reading, knowing that with the rise of the technological era, reading has become an uncommon hobby, it disheartens me. Furthermore, without reading I would have never been able to be as fluent as I am with my language,
              this helped me alot throughout the years such as for presentation. So the whole point off this page is to help people find out the kind of genre
              they like and perhaps get people to develop a reading habit. This I am sure everyone can agree does not bring any disadvantage.
