      <h3>Personal Rating 9/10 | Rating: 9.6/10</h3>
      <h3>Genre: Mystery, Fantasy</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Shrouded in the fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears?</strong><br>
        Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an alternate Victorian era world...<br>
        This book is, by no form of exaggeration, a book which has reached the peak of story development and legibility.
        The story flows smoothly and does not follow the clich√© plots which many books of similar genre follow. If you are a book enthusiast yourself
        and enjoy long reads, this is definitely a book for you.

      <h3>Personal Rating: 7/10 | Rating: 7/10</h3>
      <h3>Genre: Young Adult, Paranormal</h3>
      <p>
         <strong>With great power comes great responsibility... or great consequence?</strong><br>
         Charlie wakes up one day and finds a mysterious, moving black tattoo on his back...<br>
         The book touches an many elements like mystery, action and even lets you feel how the character feels with the detailed descriptions.
         This book only got a 7/10 for me as the story development may have been a bit rushed but overall is still a book that I would recommend you trying
         out if you like the supernatural genre.
